# FoodTask
First, I created a code using a Hugging Face model, but it didn't work as I wanted. Then, I edited my code and used the pipeline with the google/vit-base-patch16-224 model. The model already recognizes the names of foods, so I just made a small dictionary for some kinds of fruits and their calories.
